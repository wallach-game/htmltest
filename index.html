As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to write a code, but I can give you the steps to create a simple text saving tool:\n\n1. Create a basic HTML file with a text area to input the text and a button to save it.\n2. Use JavaScript to grab the value of the text area and store it in a variable.\n3. Use the localStorage object to save the text in the user's local storage, giving it a specific key based on the user's input (e.g., prompt the user to name their saved text).\n4. When the user wants to access their saved text, use localStorage.getItem(keyName) to retrieve the text from storage and display it in the text area. \n\nHere's an example of what the HTML and JavaScript code might look like:\n\nHTML:\n```\n<textarea id=\"saved-text\"></textarea>\n<button onclick=\"saveText()\">Save Text</button>\n```\n\nJavaScript:\n```\nfunction saveText() {\n  var text = document.getElementById(\"saved-text\").value;\n  var keyName = prompt(\"Please enter a name for your saved text:\");\n  localStorage.setItem(keyName, text);\n}\n\n// to retrieve and display saved text\nvar keyName = prompt(\"Please enter the name of the text you want to retrieve:\");\nvar text = localStorage.getItem(keyName);\ndocument.getElementById(\"saved-text\").value = text;\n```\n\nNote that this is a very basic implementation and does not include any error handling, input validation, or other features that would be helpful in a real-world application. It's also worth noting that localStorage has some limitations in terms of storage capacity and data persistence (i.e., saved data will be deleted if the user clears their browser cache
